# Ecommerce_Product_Recomendation_system_Machine_Learning
We'll start by collecting and preprocessing the e-commerce dataset, including product attributes, user ratings, and interactions. Next, we'll implement content-based recommendation algorithms to suggest products based on their features and user preferences. We'll then develop collaborative filtering models using techniques like matrix factorization and neighborhood-based methods to predict user-item interactions. To enhance recommendation accuracy and coverage, we'll create hybrid models that combine content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. Additionally, we'll explore multi-model recommendation strategies, integrating multiple machine learning models to provide diverse recommendations. Throughout the development process, we'll utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
